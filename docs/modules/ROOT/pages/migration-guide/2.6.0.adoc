= Camel Quarkus 2.6.0 Migration Guide

The following guide outlines how to adapt your code to changes that were made in Camel Quarkus 2.6.0 & Quarkus 2.6.0.Final.

== Graceful shutdown strategy is used by default

In previous releases, graceful shutdown strategy (default strategy in Camel) wasn't used by default.
Shutdown wasn't controlled by any strategy.

This is no longer the case.
Graceful shutdown strategy is enabled by default with one exception only.
If timeout for graceful shutdown is not set and application runs in a development mode, no shutdown strategy is used (behavior for the development mode without timeout for graceful timeout wasn't changed).

`DefaultShutdownStrategy` could be configured via `application.properties`.
For example:
```
#set graceful timeout to 15 seconds
camel.main.shutdownTimeout = 15
```
