You can use this extension without any special configuration in JVM mode.

In native mode you need to add
[source,shell]
----
quarkus.native.additional-build-args = -H:+InlineBeforeAnalysis
----
to your `application.properties`. This is to allow inlining of some static methods that would otherwise cause build failures (see this https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2594[GraalVM issue]).
