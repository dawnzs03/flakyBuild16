Depending on Minio configuration, this extension may require SSL encryption on its connections. In such cases, you will need
to add `quarkus.ssl.native=true` to your `application.properties`.
See also https://quarkus.io/guides/native-and-ssl[Quarkus native SSL guide] and xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc[Native mode]
section of Camel Quarkus user guide.

There are two different configuration approaches:

* Minio client can be defined via quarkus properties leveraging the Quarkiverse Minio (see http://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-minio#configuration-reference[documentation]).
Camel will autowire client into the Minio component.
This configuration allows definition of only one minio client, therefore it isn't possible to define several different minio endpoints, which run together.

* Provide client/clients for camel registry (e.g. CDI producer/bean) and reference them from endpoint.
