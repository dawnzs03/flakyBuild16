=== Custom body as domain object in the native mode

When using a custom object as message body and referencing its properties in the template in the native mode, all the classes need to be registered for reflection (see the https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-native-applications-tips#register-reflection[documentation]).


Example:
[source,java]
----
@RegisterForReflection
public interface CustomBody {
}
----
