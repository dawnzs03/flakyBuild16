Injection of CDI beans (described in Usage) does not work in native mode.

In the native mode the test and the application under test are running in two different processes and it is not possible
to share a mock bean between them (see https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#native-executable-testing[Quarkus documentation]).
