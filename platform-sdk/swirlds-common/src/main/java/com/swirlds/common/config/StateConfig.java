/**
 * Config that control the SignedStateManager and SignedStateFileManager behaviors.
 *
 * @param savedStateDirectory                   The directory where states are saved. This is relative to the current
 *                                              working directory, unless the provided path begins with "/", in which
 *                                              case it will be interpreted as an absolute path.
 * @param mainClassNameOverride                 Typically, the fully qualified name of the application class
 *                                              implementing {@link com.swirlds.common.system.SwirldMain SwirldMain} is
 *                                              used as a directory name when saving signed states. If this property is
 *                                              not the empty string then it overrides the main class name for signed
 *                                              states.
 * @param cleanSavedStateDirectory              If true, clean out all data in the {@link #savedStateDirectory} except
 *                                              for the previously saved state.
 * @param stateSavingQueueSize                  The number of states permitted to sit in the signed state file manager's
 *                                              queue of states being written. If this queue backs up then some states
 *                                              may not be written to disk.
 * @param saveStatePeriod                       The frequency of writes of a state to disk every this many seconds (0 to
 *                                              never write).
 * @param signedStateDisk                       Keep at least this many of the old complete signed states on disk. This
 *                                              should be at least 2 so that  we don't delete an old state while a new
 *                                              one is in the process of writing to disk. set to 0 to not keep any
 *                                              states to disk.
 * @param dumpStateOnAnyISS                     If true, save the state to disk when an ISS is detected. May negatively
 *                                              affect the performance of the node where the ISS occurs. This feature is
 *                                              for debugging purposes and should not be active in production systems.
 * @param dumpStateOnFatal                      If true, then save the state to disk when there is a fatal exception.
 * @param haltOnAnyIss                          <p>
 *                                              Halt this node whenever any ISS in the network is detected. A halt
 *                                              causes the node to stop doing work, but does not shut down the JVM.
 *                                              </p>
 *
 *                                              <p>
 *                                              This feature is for debugging purposes only. Enabling this feature in
 *                                              production environments enables a very simple denial of service attack
 *                                              on the network.
 *                                              </p>
 * @param automatedSelfIssRecovery              If true, then attempt to recover automatically when a self ISS is
 *                                              detected.
 * @param haltOnCatastrophicIss                 If true, then halt this node if a catastrophic ISS is detected. A halt
 *                                              causes the node to stop doing work, but does not shut down the JVM.
 * @param secondsBetweenISSDumps                If one ISS is detected, it is likely that others will be detected
 *                                              shortly afterward. Specify the minimum time, in seconds, that must
 *                                              transpire after dumping a state before another state dump is permitted.
 *                                              Ignored if dumpStateOnISS is false.
 * @param secondsBetweenIssLogs                 The minimum time that must pass between log messages about ISS events.
 *                                              If ISS events happen with a higher frequency then they are squelched.
 * @param enableHashStreamLogging               When enabled, hashes for the nodes are logged per round.
 * @param debugHashDepth                        When logging debug information about the hashes in a merkle tree, do not
 *                                              display hash information for nodes deeper than this.
 * @param maxAgeOfFutureStateSignatures         It's possible to receive state signatures before it's time to process
 *                                              the round signed by the signature. This is the maximum number of rounds,
 *                                              in the future, for which a node will accept a state signature.
 * @param roundsToKeepForSigning                The maximum number of rounds that a state will be kept in memory while
 *                                              waiting for it to gather enough signatures. If a state becomes fully
 *                                              signed prior to reaching this age it may be removed from memory.
 * @param roundsToKeepAfterSigning              The number of rounds to keep states after they have been signed and
 *                                              after a newer state has become fully signed. If set to 0 then each state
 *                                              becomes garbage collection eligible as soon as it is not the most
 *                                              recently signed state.
 * @param suspiciousSignedStateAge              The age of a signed state which is considered to be suspicious.
 *                                              Suspicious states cause a large amount of data to be logged that helps
 *                                              to debug the potential state leak.
 * @param stateHistoryEnabled                   If true, then a history of operations that modify the signed state
 *                                              reference count are kept for debugging purposes.
 * @param debugStackTracesEnabled               if true and stateHistoryEnabled is true, then stack traces are captured
 *                                              each time a signed state reference count is changed, and logged if a
 *                                              signed state reference count bug is detected.
 * @param requireStateLoad                      if set to true, the platform will fail to start if it fails to load
 *                                              a state from disk
 * @param emergencyStateFileName                The name of the file that contains the emergency state.
 * @param checkSignedStateFromDisk              If true, the platform will recalculate the hash of the signed state
 *                                              and check it against the written hash. It will also verify that the
 *                                              signatures are valid.
 * @param signedStateFreq                       hash and sign a state every signedStateFreq rounds. 1 means that a state
 *                                              will be signed every round, 2 means every other round, and so on. If the
 *                                              value is 0 or less, no states will be signed
