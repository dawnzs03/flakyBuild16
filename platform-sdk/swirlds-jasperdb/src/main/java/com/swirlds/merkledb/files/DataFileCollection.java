/**
 * DataFileCollection manages a set of data files and the compaction of them over time. It stores
 * data items which are key,value pairs and returns a long representing the location it was stored.
 * You can then retrieve that data item later using the location you got when storing. There is not
 * understanding of what the keys mean and no way to look up data by key. The reason the keys are
 * separate from the values is so that we can merge data items with matching keys. We only keep the
 * newest data item for any matching key. It may look like a map, but it is not. You need an
 * external index outside this class to be able to store key-to-data location mappings.
 *
 * The keys are assumed to be a contiguous block of long values. We do not have an explicit way
 * of deleting data, we depend on the range of valid keys. Any data items with keys outside the
 * current valid range will be deleted the next time they are merged. This works for our VirtualMap
 * use cases where the key is always a path and there is a valid range of path keys for internal and
 * leaf nodes. It allows very easy and efficient deleting without the need to maintain a list of
 * deleted keys.
